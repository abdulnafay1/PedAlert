# PedAlert 🚶‍♂️

**Smart infrastructure system to reduce pedestrian distraction at intersections**

PedAlert is an iOS app that detects distracted pedestrian behavior (e.g., phone use) near intersections and sends real-time alerts to improve safety—no external hardware required. It uses GPS, motion sensors, and Apple Maps integration.

## 📌 Features
- Tracks user movement and proximity to intersections via Core Location and Apple Maps APIs.
- Monitors screen activity and motion to detect distracted walking.
- Sends push notifications, vibration, or sound alerts when distraction is detected near crosswalks.
- Runs in the background, with adjustable alert modes (soft/hard).
- Logs user responses for future improvements.
